# Signal-Estimation-Theory

In digital transmission systems Viterbi is a very well-known algorithm to use it for sequence estimation problems. Implementing Viterbi-algorithm was an optimal way to remove the hindrance of digital data transmission due to inter-symbol interference (ISI). This course project focuses on the research paper 'Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation from the Lattice Viewpoint' by Wai Ho Mow, which identifies the complication in data detection when there is an additive AWGN noise and ISI. In the literature  the problem was encountered by transforming the problem of MLSE into finding the closest lattice vector. Two key features relating to lattice algorithms such as the nearest plane algorithm and the enumeration algorithm was discussed to solve the lattice close vector problem (CVP). Based on the mentioned algorithm a very effective sequence estimator was proposed for multi-level PAM and QAM systems. Improvisation was made to the work of the literature by inspecting SEP (symbol error probability) for Rician and Rayleigh channel with a higher-order modulation scheme.
